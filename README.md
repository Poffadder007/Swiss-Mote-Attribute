This project previously had a developer on it who did not complete it however, he has shared a GITHUB claiming to have completed most of the API endpoints needed

He is still responsive and helpful if we need.
Below is the entire of video exchanges we had in development. I am not a developer, and am very busy but am unhappy with his level of work. Its possible he has built alot more than I can see and simply lacks UI implementation but I do not believe that to be the case.

Future Features:
Take a screenshot of work every 3 seconds and compile into videos, label that video as the task that was being worked on, the date, and the name of the employee and upload into onedrive/google drive. 

Enter the task you are doing at the time, when you switch click finished, it gives a reward and then you enter your next one. On the backend it snips the video and saves as a seperate file with time/date and name 

Bridge WhatsApp and SwissMote communication somehow. Maybe have a WhatsApp account for each swissmote which syncs. That way WhatsApp users can message and ping and it goes straight to swissmote on their desktop. It also allows us to see the conversations. 

From the admin side, I want to be able to add task stacks, meaning it adds a task to que for someone which doesnt show up till the prior task is done.

Categorical video downloading based on the task.

When someone does a task for a certain business, that footage should go into the Google folder labeled “[Work title][date][name]”
